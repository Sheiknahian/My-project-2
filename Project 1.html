Those who have offices and other businesses go out with umbrellas overhead. in hand and clothes folded up to the knees. Sometimes they slip and fall on the mud. A rainy day is a curse for a poor man. He can't go out for his daily works. He has to sit under his leaky roof. Most of the students can not go to school. Only a few can go to school but they get wet. The cattle keep standing in their sheds and bellow for fodder. A rainy day is amusing for the rich. They make the best use of the situation.
